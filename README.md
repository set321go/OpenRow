# OpenRow

A project to design an build an open source rowing computer. This project was born from the idea that I would rather throw something cheaper than a cell phone into the water, a secondary driver was how expensive existing options are given they are in effect a specialized pedometer.

## Goals

1. Hardware and software for an acceleration based rowing computer similar in functionality to a variety of apps available for phones.
2. Speaker/Headset module integration (module provides headset functionality existing computer provides rowing data), which fits into existing headset amplifier form factor.
3. GPS & Bluetooth
4. Fitness platform compatability.

## Secondary Goals

1. Floats
2. Impeller Integration

## Design

This is purely a personal hobby project at some point it may make sense to use a funding platform to do a medium sized run with assembly but there are no plans for this. I have no background in EE.

### Circuit

I have used kicad 5. Its free and open source, you can use whatever tools you wish but you need to ensure the files in the project remain comatible with kicad.

### PCB

The current design is built to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/Capabilities) 2 layer design rules, I have no solution for providing multiple pcb's which would allow designs for multiple fabrictors. It is likely in the future to ease the design of RF components I will move to a 4 layer design.

### Assembly

Stencil and hand assembly with a homebrew toaster oven reflow setup for prototyping and testing.

### Case

3D printed - in progress

### Software

In progress

## Commercial Use

If you use this project commercially reference to its usage on the consumer device is desired but not required under the licensing terms.
